# template-proposal-review

Acting as template repo maintainer: review proposals in `proposals/` and optionally apply accepted ones to the upstream template.

## Prerequisites

- Upstream: `https://github.com/tae0y/python-project-template.git`
- Local template path (if available): ask the user — "Do you have a local clone of the template repo? If yes, provide the path."
- Proposal files follow the format generated by the `template-upstream` skill.

## Proposal Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Not yet reviewed (default) |
| `accepted` | Approved for inclusion |
| `rejected` | Declined |
| `applied` | Applied to upstream repo |

## Steps

### 1. List proposals

```bash
find proposals/ -name "proposal-*.md" | sort
```

Read each file's `**Status:**` field. Filter to `draft` only.

### 2. Review each draft

Read each `draft` proposal and evaluate against these criteria.

**Accept if:**
- Beneficial to all downstream projects, not just this one
- All project-specific values (domains, paths, secrets) are removed
- No conflict with existing template files
- Backed by localdocs evidence (learn file, ADR, or worklog entry showing real adoption)

**Reject if:**
- Pattern is specific to this project's domain
- Contains sensitive information
- Conflicts with template design principles
- No localdocs evidence and no compelling rationale — theoretical-only proposals without observed value are weak candidates

**Evidence weight:**
- `learn.*.md` citation → pattern was encountered, investigated, and adopted; strong signal
- `adr/*.md` citation → architectural decision it supports; strong signal
- `worklog.done.md` citation → task where the pattern made a difference; moderate signal
- No evidence cited → flag to user; apply higher scrutiny before accepting

Report assessment to user:

```
proposal-add-ruff-hook.md — recommend ACCEPT
  Evidence: learn.ruff-autofix.md documents friction without it; worklog.done.md shows repeated manual fix cycles
  Reason: applicable to all Python projects, no project-specific values

proposal-update-db-schema.md — recommend REJECT
  Evidence: none cited
  Reason: tied to a specific project domain; no evidence of cross-project applicability
```

### 3. Collect user decisions

```
Please decide for each proposal: Accept (A) / Reject (R) / Hold (S)
```

### 4. Update status

Update each proposal file's `**Status:**` field per user decision:
- Accept → `accepted`
- Reject → `rejected` + append `**Rejection reason:** <reason>` at end of file
- Hold → leave as `draft`

Recording rejection reasons enables context when the same proposal is resubmitted later.

### 5. Apply accepted proposals (optional)

If any proposals were accepted, ask:

```
Apply accepted proposals to the upstream template now?
This will modify files in the template repo.

Y) Apply now
N) Handle manually later
```

**If Y:**

Resolve template root in this priority order:

1. **User-provided path** — if the user provided a local path above and it exists, use it directly. No clone needed.
2. **Clone** — otherwise:

```bash
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone https://github.com/tae0y/python-project-template.git "$TMPDIR/template"
TEMPLATE_ROOT="$TMPDIR/template"
```

Apply each accepted proposal's "Proposed Change > Content" to its "Target path(s)".

Then commit:

```bash
cd "$TEMPLATE_ROOT"
git add -A
git commit -m "[NEW FEATURE] <proposal title summary>"
```

Do not push. Print the actual path and instruct the user:

```
Applied. Push with:
  cd /actual/path/to/template && git push origin main

If a temp directory was created, clean up after push:
  rm -rf /tmp/tmp.XXXXXX
```

### 6. Mark as applied

Update each applied proposal's `**Status:**` to `applied`.

### 7. Summary

```
Done:
  accepted: N
  rejected: N
  applied:  N
  on hold:  N
```
