# Commit Message Convention

All commit messages MUST be written in English. Every commit message on "main" branch MIGHT begin with one of the following prefixes:

- `[MAINTENANCE]` — no functional change: refactoring, formatting, dependency bumps, doc updates, test additions
- `[NEW FEATURE]` — new capability exposed to users or callers
- `[BREAKING CHANGES]` — incompatible change: removed/renamed tool, changed response schema, dropped API
